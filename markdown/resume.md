Experience
----------

Since 2013
:   *Data Scientist for [Airconomy](https://www.airconomy.com/)*
    (Frankfurt am Main, Germany).

    Data mining on various sources to forecast passenger demands over
    airline networks.

2009-2012
:   *PhD in Operations Research with
    [Amadeus](http://www.amadeus.com/amadeus/amadeus.html)* (Sophia
    Antipolis, France).

    Researched how to assign aircraft on an airline network in the most
    efficient way. I authored several projects, including a C++ solver,
    a Python suite of 20+ command line tools, and Hadoop data mining
    scripts. I also worked as a teaching assistant at the university,
    further improving my communication and public speaking skills.

February, 2010 — March, 2017
:   *College Instructor at [Velez College](hhttp://www.velezcollege.com/)*
    (Cebu City, Philippines).

    I acted as a college instructor and in here I started my journey into the field of coding.

    * *Physics Instructor* - Most of my time in the college I was doing lecture and laboratory instruction in Physics
    * *Mathematics Instructor* - Half of my time in the College I had been a lecturer in Algebra and Statistics.
    * *IT Instructor* - I was in charge of the college's Computer Laboratory and I am one of the instructor's who guide students doing their laboratory works especially using python for their statistics projects. 
    
June, 2005 — October, 2010
:   *Math and Physics Professor at [University of San Jose-Recoletos](https://usjr.edu.ph/)* (Cebu City, Philippines).

    This would be the start of my career in the academe, where I work as a professor on Physics and Algebra .  


    * *Physics Professor* - More than half of my time in the university I was doing lecture and laboratory instruction in Physics
    * *Algebra Professor* - For almost 5 years in the university I had my time lecturing college algebra. 


**That Other Job You Had**

Also with a short description.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Education
---------

2000-2004
:   **BSc, Physics**; Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (Iligan City, Philippines)


Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
